ECM_iNEXT.beta3D (R code and data for graphics in 2023 Ecological Monographs paper by Chao et al.)

R code and data are provided for plotting all figures in the paper "Rarefaction and extrapolation with beta diversity under a framework of Hill numbers: the iNEXT.beta3D standardization". Before using the R code, you must download the package "iNEXT.3D" and "iNEXT.beta3D" from Anne Chao's Github. 

The data used for examples are based on (i) Spatial data: tropical tree species data collected from eight rainforest fragments in Brazil; (ii) Temporal data: beetle data collected in Germany for two time periods, and tree species long time series data (2005-2017) for 6 second-growth forests in Costa Rica; and (iii) Spatio-temporal data: Scottish fish species data (1985-2010).  

"ECM_iNEXT.beta3D" includes the following files:

(1) Data Files: 

  (1a) "Data rainforest trees.xlsx" (for Figure 2 and 3): tree species data collected from eight rainforest fragments in Brazil.
  
  (1b) "Data beetles.xlsx" (for Figure 4): beetle data for two time periods (2008-2009 vs. 2010-2011).
  
  (1c) "Data second-growth trees.xlsx" (for Figure 5): tree species data in six second-growth forests from 2005-2017.
  
  (1d) "Data fish_Lat55-60.csv" (for Figure 6): Scottish fish data between latitude 55 and 60 from 1985-2010.
